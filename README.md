# ctags tap for Homebrew

The last *ctags* release on offer, 5.8, [dates from July 2009][1], and further development on the original repo would be surprising, to say the least. This repo makes [the most active, consistently updated fork of *ctags*][2] available as a tap in [Homebrew][3]. To use, do:

    brew tap kopischke/ctags
    brew install ctags-fishman --HEAD

## Caveat

As the fishman fork has no version scheme, you **have** to use the `--HEAD` option when installing to get the fork â€“ a plain `brew install ctags-fishman` will install the regular 5.8 release, which is probably not what you want.
